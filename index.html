           Welcome
            <br />
            <br />
                This website is being designed with the intention of providing a forum for MSSA students to collaborate. Are
                you experiencing difficulty in developing an idea for a project? Are you curious to know what other students are working
                on throughout the other cohorts? Are you working on a project, but you are running into issues that perhaps another student
                would be able to provide assistance? This website will provide solutions to all of those issues. At the very least,
                students contributing their projects to this website will learn HTML5/CSS and familiarity with GitHub. You will also
                be able to pull up any projects you have completed or coninuing to develop at any moment. This can prove hugely beneficial
                if you are in the middle of an interview!
             <br />
             <br />
                We are looking to collaborate with a few students to intially launch this website. Ideally, we would like to collaborate
                with people who are interested in programming, have a few projects underway, and <div id="wordDisplay"> </div> <button onclick="newWord()"></button><script type="text/javascript" src="1.js"></script>
