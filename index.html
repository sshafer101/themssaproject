            Welcome!
            <br />
            <br />
            Borne from the desire to create, learn and collaborate, the MSSA Project is something for all students to take
            part in. At its essence, the MSSA Project is nothing more than a foundation. However, with contributions from
            MSSA students across the country, the MSSA Project can quickly become a tool that future students use to navigate
            their transition from the military. Future students will be able to use the projects you create and post as
            inspiration for their own ventures. Before long, the MSSA Project can function as an interactive virtual-classroom where
            you can view what your classmates are working on in San Diego, and also contribute to a project that students in San Antonio
            have been experiencing issues with. What's more is that you can take your projects on-the-go since you can access all
            of the projects from any where and at any time. Hopefully, the MSSA Project can prove to be more than just a foundation,
            and instead become a spring board for all of us into our next careers.

            We are looking to collaborate with a few students to intially launch this website. Ideally, we would like to collaborate
            with people who are interested in programming, have a few projects underway, and <!--<div id="wordDisplay"> </div> <button onclick="newWord()"></button><script type="text/javascript" src="1.js"></script>-->
