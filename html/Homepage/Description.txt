Welcome! Borne from the desire to create, learn and collaborate, the MSSA Project is something for all students to take
part in. At its essence, the MSSA Project is nothing more than a foundation. However, with contributions from 
MSSA students across the country, the MSSA Project can quickly become a tool that future students use to navigate
their transition from the military. Future students will be able to use the projects you create and post as 
inspiration for their own ventures. Before long, the MSSA Project can function as an interactive virtual-classroom where
you can view what your classmates are working on in San Diego, and also contribute to a project that students in San Antonio
have been experiencing issues with. What's more is that you can take your projects on-the-go since you can access all
of the projects from any where and at any time. Hopefully, the MSSA Project can prove to be more than just a foundation,
and instead become a spring board for all of us into our next career.
